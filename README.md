Slack theme based on Flatland
===========

My favorite theme for SublimeText is [Flatland](https://github.com/thinkpixellab/flatland) by Pixel Lab. I customized my terminal around the colors, and I did the same with Slack. Open up preferences and past the following into the custom section.

'''
#4B4F53,#313437,#2095F0,#FFFFFF,#E37234,#C4E2F2,#FFFFFF,#E37234
'''
